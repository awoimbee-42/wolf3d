Simple raycaster in C, by wta and awoimbee

One of my worst project.

texture 0 = east  wall (stone I sthink)
texture 1 = west  wall (LORRAINE) - bad
texture 2 = north wall (brick - minecraft)
texture 3 = south wall (sandstone - minecraft)
texture 4 = floor      (wood - minecraft)
texture 5 = ceiling    (stars)
